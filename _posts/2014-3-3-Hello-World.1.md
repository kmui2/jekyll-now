Tonight, Hinatsu, Anna, Daniel, Minh, and I played Wii Super Smash Bros together. Anna had the most play time while Minh had the least. Then, we played Catan. Hinatsu had 4 cities on gum (5) and wheat (5). We all thought either Anna and Daniel or Hinatsu would win because they had a lot of development cards. But in the end, Minh won because I used my brick port to give him the missing advantage. I was losing horribly because I lacked wheat and gum.
