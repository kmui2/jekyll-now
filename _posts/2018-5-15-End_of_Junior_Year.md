### How was the semester?

I think this semester is the least semester I've enjoyed because of the brutal classes this semester. 

### Which classes were great and bad?

I thought Microelectronics was a good class. I wished I had more time for the final project because that project was killing me at the end of the semester. Theatre 357 was a good class because I got to know about my classmates and worked together in making a show.

I disliked Microelectronic Circuits and Intro to Algorithms. The homework for Microelectronic Circuits were useless. The class should be taught with a discussion and provide more study material. The lectures were boring and went too fast. Homework for Intro to Algorithms were very tough to grasp. I disliked being bothered by others on the homework and cramming for exams. No matter how hard I study, my performance will mostly be affected by my spirit.

### What did you get out of this semester?

To be honest, I think getting that microcontrollers experience is probably the only big thing that came out of this semester. 

### What would you have done differently?

I wish I hadn't dropped 340 last semester. The material I learned in 340 isn't in my interest. 

### What advice would you give to others?

I would advise not to do a computer engineering and computer science double major. I think picking either one is better and you can pick out which classes you want to take from the other major. 

### What will you do in summer before your internship?

Other than working, I'm planning on making a game using Phaser.js. I will likely try to recreate the games we made in our microelectronics class. Since I used react native in my last hackathon, I might also think about making an facial recognition app with it. There is also an empty repo for a messenger chrome extention that I might want to pick up.

### How was your work-life balance from this semester?

This is something I struggle on recently. I put way to much unnecessary work on my final project for 353. I really want to do away from heavy work loads. I'm trying to go out more often and seeing other people. 

### What is your goal for your future?

I want to move to a larger city with more places to go and everying is within walking distance. I like cities with great transportation and maybe America is not the place. I am more interested in start-ups and innovative companies because I like developing and being with people who are motivated and care about their products.
