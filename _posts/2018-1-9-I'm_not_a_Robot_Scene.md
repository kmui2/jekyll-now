**Baek Gyoon**: So, you are asking me to make this for you?

Ji A: Yes you are a genius so I'm sure you can make it.

**Baek Gyoon**: That's probably true but why are you trying to make something liek this anyway?

**Ji A**: I think it would be great to have something like this. 

When a couple are walking with an umbrella and they want to feel as if they're walking in the rain, then they can press the button to make the umbrella transparent. 

And then when they want to kiss each other all of a sudden, they can make it opaque again to kiss secretly without others knowing.

Wouldn't people really want something like this if it ever existed?

Baek Gyoon: I understand but edont' you think that only a small group of people would want something like this?

**Ji A**: Is it not okay to make something for a smaller audience?

Something that people don't know about but it would be great to have if it existed. I want to make things like that.

But I can't make it since I don't have the technology to do so.

So I'm trying to make it by working with a person like you that has the brains and the technology to do so.

And it would be even better if we could make money off of it as well.

Won't you make it?
