title: Mini Hotpot

Hinatsu, John, Minh, Anna, Jay, Ash, and I went to Mini Hotpot on Park St. today. Half of use picked the spiciest broth but Anna picked the coconut broth. The meal was over $17 and we barely paid any tip to the waitress. Then, we went to the Korean store next door and Daniel bought a large Korean drink for $5. We walked back to the Frances around a lake. When we got back, all of us except Ash played Smash and Catan.
