title: Prejudice and Theatre of the Oppressed
---

## Warmup

- Go around and say our names and how we're feeling
	- Christina and Soyoung are new and both Korean
- Played chairs game of asking someone whether they loved their neighbor
	- Yes will stall the game
	- No and the subject is forced to say what kind of person they love so those subjects would exchange seats while the last to find a seat plays the role of the asker

## TCSA Video

- Watched the DVD that gives a brief overview of an example performance
- Got to see a Black person's experience
- They performed where a white guy was trying to play around with a black guy

## Prejudice and Theatre of the Oppressed

- Discussed with Crow (Hyuk), Minje, and Christina on the articles
- Went through prejudice, prejudment, and then the theare of the oppressed
- Then discussed with the whole group
	- Gabe talked about his experience with Egyptian Uber driver
	- Hope said something about second voice that judges racism
	- Jorge mentioned stereotypes that come up when somebody realizes he's Mexican

## Conclusion

- I think I can talk about how passive prejudgments are formed from my own experience.
